# Project-Title: Data Science employment opportunities in Australia

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109832565/190567544-cf01d579-eb63-4f88-a4e2-c3a6665e6c0c.png)


## Background

_"According to an IBM report, data science jobs will show a growth of 30%. As per the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, about 11 million jobs would be created by the year 2026. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics further predicts a stupendous growth in the data science field between now and 2029, with professionals being paid quite well. According to a websource, Data scientist is ranked #3 in best technology jobs on the global charts!"(See References)_

Now the question is, Do we have data that supports this narration? If yes, how is the field doing in Australia? Are data scientists being paid well in Australia? What job titles are at the top in terms of salary? How about the distribution of opportunities among different states? Does being in Metro or Regional affects the job opportunities? What skills are the pre-requisites? 

### Before You Begin

1. Create a new repository for this project and name it as **project-two**. 
   **Do not add this to an existing repository**.

2. Clone the new repository to your computer and as it's a group project, copy the url and send it to the contributors so that they can also clone on their computers. Don't forget to add them as contributors first by going into the project settings. We created branches so that the contributors can contribute in their own branch and later we can just push the final product to the main.

3. Inside your local Git repository, create a directory. Use a folder name such as: **Resources**.

4. Inside the folder you just created, put your csv files named as datascience_jobs_aus.csv and datascience_listing.csv. These will be the two datasets that you'll be using for your ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) process. We got these datasets from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

5. For the ETL process, create two files namely queries.sql and data_etl.ipynb. These are the files where you'll write your main code, we'll discuss it further later on.

6. Add a .gitignore file as a good practice in case you want to keep any confidential files in it like your API keys, your password or username. .gitignore file will keep all the files hidden from being published publicly even if your repository is public. For username and password, open your .gitignore file and in the first line type the following:

```python
# Adding config.py file.
config.py
```

7. Add a README.md file to share your approach towards project.

8. Push the above changes to GitHub.

## Project Proposal

The detailed project proposal is attached in repo in the pdf form, please refer to the pdf file with name project proposal for understanding of the project in detail.

## Extracting, Transforming and Loading process (ETL)

### Extract

### Transform

### Load

## Technical Report

The detailed technical report is attached in repo in the pdf form, please refer to the pdf file with name technical report for understanding of the technical aspects of the project in detail.


**Note:** We have used one dataset from a previous project which you can find at https://github.com/AnamKhalid09/project-one.git. The data used is fresh at the time of publication, therefore trends might change in future. For that, it is recommended to use the fresh data for this project. Recommendations and pull requests are welcome!
